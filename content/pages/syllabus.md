Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Format and Description
----------------------

In this course, students take turns in giving lectures. For the most part, the lectures are based on Robert Osserman's classic book _A Survey of Minimal Surfaces_, and Michael Spivak's _Calculus on Manifolds_, Manfredo Do Carmo's _Curves and Surfaces_.  Lars Ahlfors' _Complex Analysis_ will also be referred to at various points. Note that Do Carmo treats only surfaces in _R{{< sup "3" >}}_; many things are easy to generalise; some things do not generalise or it is difficult to see how they do. Spivak refers to '_Calculus on Manifolds_'; Spivak 3 and 4 refer to volumes of his '_Differential Geometry_' series.

Recommended Reading
-------------------

Students may wish to consult additional material when preparing lectures. Osserman's book has a long list of references, which he refers to throughout the text.

Recommended Reading About Reading
---------------------------------

For general information about reading mathematics, students should consult the article "{{% resource_link "4c783fe9-3fac-4271-80ce-634ee8457e37" "How to Read Mathematics" %}}" by Shai Simonson and Fernando Gouveau. It is published on the web, and talks about the language of mathematics, and how best to approach it.

Homework
--------

Homework assignments are handed out each Wednesday, and are due the following Wednesday. The lowest homework grade can be dropped. No late homework is accepted.

Students may work together on homework assignments, in fact they are encouraged to do so. However, they must write up their homework assignment by themselves.
